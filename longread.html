                <p>Les Misérables is a French
                historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th
                century. Les Misérables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television and the stage, including
                a musical.
                
                 Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the
                novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean
                and his experience of redemption.
                
                Examining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban
                design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and
                familial love.</p>

            <h3>Volume I:Fantine</h3>
            <p>The story begins in 1815 in Digne, as the peasant Jean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in the Bagne
            of Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape
            attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the
            street, angry and bitter.
            
            Digne's benevolent Bishop Myriel gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police
            capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver
            candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells
            Valjean that his soul has been purchased for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an
            honest man of himself.
            
            Valjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-sous coin from
            12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and searches the city in panic for Gervais. At the
            same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him, because if apprehended he
            will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.
            
            Six years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed
            mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart.
            When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath
            the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector Javert, who was an adjutant guard at
            the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable
            feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.
            
            Years earlier in Paris, a grisette named Fantine was very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier,
            Fameuil, and Blachevelle were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the
            women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and
            Tholomyès' daughter, Cosette. When Fantine arrives at Montfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of the Thénardiers, a
            corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.
            
            Fantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try
            to meet their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory,
            because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands
            continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the
            Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.
            
            A dandy named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She
            begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean
            (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling
            responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a
            hospital.
            
            Javert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to
            the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else
            as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal
            himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his
            true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.
            
            After Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine
            discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then
            reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies.
            Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later,
            Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.</p>

            <p>Valjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life.
            While imprisoned in the Bagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging.
            Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities
            report him dead and his body lost.
            
            Valjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her
            to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters Éponine and
            Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an
            expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier
            is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and
            lodging.
            
            The next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately
            accepts, while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean
            pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean,
            runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot
            release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer
            to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier
            regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back toward home.
            
            Valjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily.
            However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from
            Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once
            rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and
            Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.</p>

            <td><h3>Volume III: Marius</h3>
            <p>Eight years later, the Friends of the ABC, led by Enjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanist civil unrest (i.e.
            the Paris uprising on 5–6 June 1832, following the death of General Lamarque, the only French leader who had sympathy
            towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its
            poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells). The Friends of the ABC are joined
            by the poor of the Cour des miracles, including the Thénardiers' eldest son Gavroche, who is a street urchin.
            
            One of the students, Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially his royalist grandfather M.
            Gillenormand) because of his Bonapartist views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius
            discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved his life at
            Waterloo—in reality Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a
            sergeant under Napoleon to avoid exposing himself as a robber.
            
            At the Luxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved
            to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname "Jondrette" at Gorbeau House
            (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius
            lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.
            
            Éponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove
            her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing "The Cops Are Here" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and
            gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the "Jondrettes" in their apartment through a crack in the
            wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look
            poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she
            does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).
            
            The philanthropist and his daughter enter—actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After
            seeing them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks
            Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The
            Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid of the
            Patron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.
            
            Marius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs
            him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive.
            Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money,
            Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Thénardier
            as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.
            
            He tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him
            that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean
            to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they
            would keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his
            address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone, and announces the
            address is a fake.
            
            It is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and
            Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into
            the Thénardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme.
            Thénardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.
            
            He arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (except Claquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison,
            and Montparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the
            scene before Javert sees him.</p>

            <td><h3>Volume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis</h3>
            <p>After Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at "The Field of the Lark" and sadly tells him that she found
            Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few
            days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette and Brujon
            manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal
            activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's
            house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole
            neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that
            she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.
            
            The next day, Valjean is sitting in the Champ de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the
            neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap, which says "Move Out." He sees a figure running away
            in the dim light. He goes back to his house, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de
            l'Homme-Armé, and reconfirms to her that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M.
            Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry, but has been longing for Marius's return. When
            tempers flare, he refuses his assent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted,
            Marius leaves.
            
            The following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and
            informs Enjolras that Javert is a spy. When Enjolras confronts him about this, he admits his identity and his orders to
            spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him up to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening,
            Marius goes back to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, but finds the house no longer occupied. He then hears a
            voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the
            voice and goes.
            
            When Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a
            soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier
            fires, fatally wounding the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top
            of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will
            blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.
            
            Marius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot
            for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies
            dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die
            together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.
            
            The author also states to the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that
            she has a letter for him. She also confesses to have obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give
            it to him, but decides to do so in fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the
            letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last
            breath, she confesses that she was "a little bit in love" with him, and dies.
            
            Marius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is written by Cosette. He learns Cosette's
            whereabouts and he writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with
            Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a
            National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.</p>

            <p>Valjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect
            Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges.
            When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.
            
            Valjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight, and
            then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the
            barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean
            escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol, and reaches an exit gate but finds it
            locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Thénardier, but Thénardier does not recognize Valjean.
            Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches
            Valjean and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can later find out his
            identity. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's
            emergence from the sewer will distract the police who have been pursuing him.
            
            Upon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him.
            Surprisingly Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's
            house, Valjean asks to be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will
            wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert
            walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown
            him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to
            cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.
            
            Marius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a
            fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during Mardi Gras festivities, Valjean is
            spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is
            an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's
            time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius' judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live
            and retires to his bed.
            
            Thénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what
            he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of
            the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he
            tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who
            rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then
            confronts Thénardier with his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the
            offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes a slave trader.
            
            As they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find
            Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is
            buried beneath a blank slab in Père Lachaise Cemetery.</p>

                    <dd>Jean Valjean (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) – The
                    protagonist of the novel. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent
                    to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added
                    twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a
                    former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to
                    become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped
                    by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse Valjean from his reverie
                    and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name, and the name of the boy, and this allows the police to charge
                    him with armed robbery - a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new
                    identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and
                    eventually builds two factories and becomes one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor. He
                    confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and
                    rescues Cosette from the Thénardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades
                    capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade,
                    reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death,
                    having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.</dd>

                    <dd>Javert - A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a
                    fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the
                    overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just
                    what he looks like). Eventually he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into
                    conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad and
                    Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the Police Inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be
                    incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests of M. Madeleine that he be
                    dismissed in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself
                    in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean
                    escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He then almost recaptures Valjean at Gorbeau house when he
                    arrests the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is
                    discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the
                    sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile
                    his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect
                    of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he
                    takes his own life by jumping into the Seine.</dd>

                    daughter Cosette in the care of the Thénardiers, innkeepers in the village of Montfermeil. Mme. Thénardier spoils her
                    own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write
                    letters to the Thénardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her.
                    To meet the Thénardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth, and turns to prostitution.
                    She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names
                    and threw snow down her back, and sends her to a hospital. As Javert confronts Valjean in her hospital room, because her
                    illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock after Javert reveals that Valjean is a convict and hasn't brought her
                    daughter Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged that incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was
                    because he was bringing her daughter to her).</dd>

                    drudge for the Thénardiers. After her mother Fantine dies, Valjean ransoms Cosette from the Thénardiers and cares for
                    her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls

                    falls in love with Cosette and fights on the barricades when he believes Valjean has taken her to London. After he and

                    <dd>Éponine (the Jondrette girl) – The Thénardiers' elder daughter. As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents,
                    but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to
                    obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius' request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and
                    sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and Brujon from robbing the house during one of
                    Marius' visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the
                    barricades, hoping that she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before Marius, she reaches out her hand
                    to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she
                    is dying, she confesses all this to Marius, and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that
                    once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his
                    part, but out of pity for her hard life.</dd>
